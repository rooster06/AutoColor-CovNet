# AutoColor-CovNet

This project is a very basic implementation of an automatic image coloring ConvNet regressor, inspired by the SIGGRAPH 2016 paper on deep colorization. The results can be seen at the end of this page. As you can/will see the very simple Network does a decent job of predicting the chrominance of the image, and looks pretty similar to output of a sepia filter.
